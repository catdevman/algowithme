# Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers, write a function to find the maximum product of any three numbers in the array.

# Example Inputs and Expected Outputs:

1) Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: 60
Explanation: The maximum product is 4 * 5 * 3 = 60.

2) Input: [-10, -7, 5, 3, 2]
Output: 350
Explanation: The maximum product is -10 * -7 * 5 = 350.

3) Input: [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1]
Output: -6
Explanation: The maximum product is -2 * -1 * -3 = -6.

# Range of Inputs:

The input array can contain both positive and negative integers.
The length of the array can range from 3 to 10^5 elements.

# Range of Outputs:

The output is an integer representing the maximum product of three numbers in the array.
The output can be negative or positive, depending on the input.
